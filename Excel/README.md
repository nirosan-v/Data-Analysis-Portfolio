# Excel Projects

I have a comprehensive understanding of key Excel functions and tools. My skills include using `Pivot Tables` for data summarisation and `XLOOKUP` for advanced lookups, along with commonly used functions like `COUNTIF` and `SUMIFS` for conditional calculations. I also effectively use `CONCATENATE` to combine data and `TEXT` functions like `TRIM` and `SUBSTITUTE` for cleaning datasets. Additionally, I leverage `Conditional Formatting` to highlight trends and Excelâ€™s charting capabilities to visualise insights. I also develop interactive dashboards that combine these tools to present data-driven solutions and insights.
