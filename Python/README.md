# Python Projects

I have developed a strong foundation in Python programming focused on data analysis and automation. My experience includes using `Pandas` for data manipulation, `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping, and `Seaborn` & `Matplotlib` for visualisation. I specialise in data cleaning and transforming raw datasets into structured formats, and in automating tasks to streamline workflows. Additionally, I leverage Python's data capabilities to uncover insights from complex datasets, driving data-driven decisions and optimising processes.
