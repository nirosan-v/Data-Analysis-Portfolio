# Larger Projects
This section showcases my larger projects found on my [website](https://nirosan-v.github.io/-NirosanVijayakumar.github.io/) that demonstrate my expertise in data analysis using SQL and Tableau. Below, you will find descriptions of each project, along with accompanying images that illustrate the work completed.

## [London Job Data](https://nirosan-v.github.io/-NirosanVijayakumar.github.io/project_one.html)
**Key Skills**: Queries, Data Manipulation, Aggregation Functions, Trend Analysis, Data Visualisation  
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing UK job data using SQL to ensure accuracy for insightful analysis. It involves crafting complex queries for data manipulation, removing duplicates, standardising formats, and handling null values. I also used aggregation functions to derive insights about job distribution and salary trends. After cleaning, Tableau is utilised for dynamic visualisation, allowing exploration of relationships between jobs, salaries, and population size, ultimately providing valuable insights for data-driven decision-making.

## [Airline Customer Data](https://nirosan-v.github.io/-NirosanVijayakumar.github.io/project_two.html)
**Key Skills**: SQL Queries, Data Integrity, Standardisation, Null Handling, Dashboard Design  
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing an airline customer dataset using SQL to ensure accuracy and consistency for effective analysis. It involves handling null values, removing duplicates, and standardising data formats while validating all records. The cleaned dataset is primed for comprehensive analysis, emphasising customer segmentation and lifetime value (CLV). Subsequently, Tableau is used for visualisation, revealing key metrics like flight frequency and customer demographics, thus facilitating data-driven decision-making in the airline industry.
