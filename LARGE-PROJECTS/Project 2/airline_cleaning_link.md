In the Tableau dashboard, the focus is on presenting the cleaned airline customer data through intuitive and actionable visualisations. The dashboard features several key charts, including a heat map, pie chart, bar graph, and line graph, designed to explore flight activity, customer demographics, and geographical trends. Interactive features allow users to filter the data by province, gender, and age group, enabling a detailed examination of flight patterns and customer segments. These visualisations help users quickly identify high-demand regions, age groups with frequent flyers, and gender-based travel trends, providing insights that support customer segmentation and marketing strategies in the airline industry.
