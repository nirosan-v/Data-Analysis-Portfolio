# SQL Projects

I have a strong command of essential SQL operations such as `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `HAVING`, and `LIMIT`. My expertise extends to more advanced concepts like `JOINS`, `UNIONS`, `STRING FUNCTIONS`, `CASE STATEMENTS`, `SUBQUERIES`, and `WINDOW FUNCTIONS`. I also work with `CTEs` (Common Table Expressions), Temporary Tables, Stored Procedures, Triggers, and Events to efficiently manage and manipulate data. With these skills, I can query large datasets, optimise data retrieval, and perform complex data transformations, ensuring performance and scalability in data-driven decision-making.
